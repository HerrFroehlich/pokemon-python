# pokemon-python
a pokemon battle simulator written in python

Credit to github.com/Zarel this was a spin off his Pokemon-Showdown code but I simply stripped out the core simulator code and left all
the web-app related code.

The goal for this simulator is to have two AIs play against each other, so it will be built with that in mind.
